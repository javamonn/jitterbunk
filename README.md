jitterbunk
==========

Simple Django app running [jitterbunk](http://stanfordflipside.com/2011/02/stanford-students-found-revolutionary-startup-that-does-nothing/), a parody startup where you can only "bunk" (think facebook poke) your friends. Done as a bootcamp project for my onboarding at [CodeHS](https://codehs.com/).
